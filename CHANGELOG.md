# Changelog

## Version 0.2

+ In arguments, lists accepts empty elements (#3)
+ Separate dalton *dal* inputs (#5) 
+ Allow to perform HF and DFT calculation with dalton (#6)
+ Allow to contribute pv contributions if only the static properties are available
+ Add some vibrational contribution to second hyperpolarizability (`[α²]⁰⁰`, `[µβ]⁰⁰`, `[µ²α]¹⁰`, `[µ²α]⁰¹`, partially #4)

## Version 0.1.1

+ Bugfix: a too strong assumption on the symmetry of the tensor leads to incorrect values for certain components (#8).
+ Add a changelog (#7) .


## Version 0.1

First version. All program created and working.

ZPVA available for any property. Pure vibrational contributions available for the polarizability and the first hyperpolarizability.
