## Installation

See [the instalation page](./documentation/source/install.rst) for the procedure.

## Documentation

A (maybe outdated) PDF file explaining how to use nachos is available [here](./documentation/source/nachos-howto.pdf).

You can build the full documentation with `make doc`.

## Contributing

You can reports bugs and suggestions any time by email or using the bugtracker.

If you want to contribute to the code, see the [contribution page](./documentation/source/contributing.rst). 
Please note that the code is not actually developed on the git server of the University of Namur (which only contains the releases) but on a personal protected git server (with CI activated and properly configured). 
Feel free to ask access if needed.
