# NACHOS

Code for numerical differentiation of energy (oriented toward computation of vibrational contributions).
Maintained by [Pierre Beaujean](pierre.beaujean@unamur.be) and created in the frame of my PhD thesis in the [University of Namur](https://www.unamur.be).

Based on [qcip_tools](https://gitlab.unamur.be/pierre.beaujean/qcip_tools) version [0.4.1](https://gitlab.unamur.be/pierre.beaujean/qcip_tools/tree/release-v0.4.1).

## Installation

See [the instalation page](./documentation/source/install.rst) for the procedure.

## Documentation

A (maybe outdated) PDF file explaining how to use nachos is available [here](./documentation/source/nachos-howto.pdf).

You can build the full documentation with `make doc`.

## Contributing

You can reports bugs and suggestions any time by email or using the bugtracker.

If you want to contribute to the code, see the [contribution page](./documentation/source/contributing.rst). 
Please note that the code is not actually developed on the git server of the University of Namur (which only contains the releases) but on a personal protected git server (with CI activated and properly configured). 
Feel free to ask access if needed.
